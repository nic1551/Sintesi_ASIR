# CONFIGURATION

It is very important that we create a small file in APACHE save files.

We have to modify it. It must contain the port (<Virtual asterisk:80> in my case), the server name, server alias, Document root **very important**, error log and custom log.

Additionally we have two aliases. One is the web page and the other is the index.php script.
